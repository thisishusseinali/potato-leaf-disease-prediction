## Potato Leaf Disease Prediction Project Description
Here, we’ll develop an end-to-end Deep Learning project in the field of agriculture. We will create a simple Image Classification Model that will categorize Potato Leaf Disease using a simple and classic Convolutional Neural Network Architecture.

## Problem Statement for Potato Leaf Disease Prediction :
Farmers who grow potatoes suffer from serious financial standpoint losses each year which cause several diseases that affect potato plants. 
The diseases Early Blight and Late Blight are the most frequent. 
Early blight is caused by fungus and late blight is caused by specific micro-organisms and if farmers detect this disease early and apply appropriate treatment then it can save a lot of waste and prevent economical loss. 
The treatments for early blight and late blight are a little different so it’s important that you accurately identify what kind of disease is there in that potato plant. 
Behind the scene, we are going to use Convolutional Neural Network – Deep Learning to diagnose plant diseases.
